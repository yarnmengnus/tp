ProfPlan is a **desktop CLI app for managing tasks, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ProfPlan can get your task management done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.


1. Download the latest `profplan.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for ProfPlan.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar profplan.jar` 
   command to run the application.<br>

   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all tasks.

   * `todo set finals /by 02 Nov 2023`: Adds a task titled `set finals` to the task list.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd task shown in the current list.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in square brackets are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `task [taskToDo] /by [deadline]`, `taskToDo` and `deadline` are parameters which can be used as `add n/John 
  Doe`.

* Items in braces are optional.<br>

* Items with `…` after them can accept multiple parameters. If these items are in braces, they can be used 0 times 
  as well.<br>
  e.g. `[keywords…]` can be used as `quiz`, `mock midterm` etc.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Assigning Priority to a Task : `priority` [Coming Soon]

Assigns a priority level to a task ranging from 1 to 10. You may specify any integer number between 1 to 10, with 1 signifying low priority and 10 signifying higher priority.

Format: `priority [taskNumber] /p [priority]`

* `[taskNumber]` - Integer, a valid task number in the list.
* `[priority]` - Integer, ranging from 1 to 10, representing the priority level.

Examples:
* `priority 3 /p 8` assigns priority level 8 to the 3rd task.
* `priority 1 /p 5` assigns priority level 5 to the 1st task.

### Locating a task: `find`

Finds tasks which have titles or descriptions that contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `find [KEYWORDS...]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `Quiz` will match `quiz`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Canvas quiz` will match `quiz canvas`
* Only the titles and descriptions are searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Canva` will not match `Canvas`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `midterm paper` will return `mock midterm`, `final paper`

Examples:
* `find quiz` returns `set Canvas quiz` and `Quiz TAs`
* `find grade midterm` returns `transfer grade to Canvas`, `set midterm`<br>

### Set task as parent: `set`

Sets a given task as the parent task of another given task.

Format: `set [parentTaskIndex] [childTaskIndex]`

* Both `parentTaskIndex` and `childTaskIndex` begin from 1, indexing from the current list.
* Will fail if the indices are the same, if the indices are out of bounds, or if the task at `childTaskIndex` is the 
  parent of the task at `parentTaskIndex`.

Examples:
* `set 1 4` sets the first task in the list as the parent of the fourth task in the list.

### Saving the data

ProfPlan data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

ProfPlan data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/ProfPlan.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, ProfPlan will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.
</div>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that 
contains the data in the previous ProfPlan home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
